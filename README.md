# orth - ortholinear software keyboard on iOS

## Synopsis

I hate staggered keyboard and I normally use jj40 (ortholinear keyboard).

( I ordered [planck](https://olkb.com/), but I am waiting to receive it for more than half year... )

jj40 is awesome and I can't return to staggered keyboard.

iOS on screen keyboard is staggered. It is not so bad. However I make some trivial on screen keyboard for fun.

## Depends on

- FlexLayout (with carthage)

## See also

`./keymap.c` is `qmk_firmware` source code for my __endgame__ layout.

This project's keymap is based on this.
